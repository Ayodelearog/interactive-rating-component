## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

I learned how to work better with event handlers as I had to use the browser DOM to find my specific target. I also learned to use hooks in react like the useContext hook that I used pass down props to child components in order to avoid prop drilling. I also learned to render UI to the browser on button click. Lastly, I learned about CSS ":focus" pseudo-class, and how to use it.



### Continued development

I'd like to get better at manipulating the DOM in my code and also use TypeScript interfaces better.
